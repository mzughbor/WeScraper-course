ISP emphasizes the importance of breaking down interfaces into smaller, specialized ones, reducing unnecessary dependencies and complexity. Through practical examples and discussions, you'll understand how applying ISP leads to more modular, maintainable software designs, fostering better scalability and flexibility in your codebases.",
