        "description": "Real numbers are the numbers which include both rational and irrational numbers. Rational numbers such as integers (-2, 0, 1), fractions(1/2, 2.5) and irrational numbers such as \u221a3, \u03c0(22/7), etc., are all real numbers.What's a real number in math? Real number, in mathematics, a quantity that can be expressed as an infinite decimal expansion. ... The real numbers include the positive and negative integers and fractions (or rational numbers) and also the irrational numbers.Is 0 a real number? Real numbers can be positive or negative, and include the number zero. They are called real numbers because they are not imaginary, which is a different system of numbers. Imaginary numbers are numbers that cannot be quantified, like the square root of -1.",
