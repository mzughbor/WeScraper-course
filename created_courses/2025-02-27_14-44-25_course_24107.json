        "description": "Many of you may recognise this process if you bought my Watercolour Secrets DVDs in the past, or viewed the lessons more recently on Art Tutor. It\u2019s based upon using a few very simple geometric shapes to construct animals, though the technique can be used for human figures, landscape objects, buildings, vehicles - in fact virtually anything. However, it\u2019s one of those skills that benefit from periodically re-visiting, as a reminder to those who still struggle and as an aid to those who are just setting out. Even experienced artists will tell you that regularly doing some little basic doodles like this refreshes their brain and helps them from over-complicating pictures. The Problem - And the Solution One of the difficulties for anyone learning to draw is that the brain tries to take in all the information and detail it sees in their subject and then in attempting to transfer it to paper all in one go, shapes and proportions become jumbled up and distorted. Very quickly, the item they\u2019re drawing appears all misshapen and wrong and frustration sets in. Fear not. The solution can be pretty straightforward and that, as with many things art, is to simplify. If I gave you the following list of numbers to look at for five seconds then look away for 30 seconds and then repeat them aloud, you'd probably struggle..... 402 626 285 517 783 However, if I rounded them up or down to the nearest 100, you'd find things a lot easier to recall. So we have:- 400 600 300 500 800 In fact, you'd probably instinctively simplify even further in your head, remembering 4,6,3,5 & 8 and then just add the hundreds to each one as you quoted them. And that's really all we're going to do here, except we use a pencil and simplify a complex figure to just five basic geometric shapes - the triangle, oval, oblong, circle and square. In fact, if you think that the oval and oblong are just a stretched circle and square respectively, you've actually only three shapes to think about. In this short lesson, we\u2019re going to look how to draw a flamingo, a wondrous mix of elegant body, spindly legs, the oddest-shaped beak and never-ending neck. I\u2019ve chosen this because as you\u2019ll see, it\u2019s made up of just those few shapes that can be easily reproduced. The only area that we then have to deal with is getting the relative proportions correct of each part of the body. In a previous life, I developed a fair amount of drawing skills attending many a boring meeting, waiting for my items to be discussed. This was long before Art Tutor was born but the reverse of those agenda papers provided an endless source of free drawing surfaces... Ok, I couldn\u2019t take a photo of a flamingo into the meeting with me, but by then, I was able to keep images in my head which I used to re-create from memory. You can do the same the more you try it. Sketch by sketch, the easier it becomes. This is how we (you) do it. Let's Get Started Here\u2019s the main reference photo of a lovely pink flamingo on a bright, sunny day. It\u2019s a classic pose, with the bird in shallow water, ready to use that huge beak to dig out morsels from the silt for his lunch. 1Pixbernswaelz.jpg Now if you step back and observe the photo, you can see that it\u2019s quite easy to break down into several basic shapes. The body forms a convenient oval, with the tail creating a triangular bit at the rear. The long neck can be represented by a couple of oblongs, while the head and the beak can, for now, be sketched as a small oval and triangle respectively. 2Flamingo and Shapes.png You can see from the blue shapes that I\u2019ve overlaid on the photo how very simple the technique is. Not only does the image look much less daunting, but this is going to help considerably in making sure your proportions are correct before you start on the details. 3Shapes Only.png Here, I\u2019ve deleted the photo and we\u2019re left with the basic shapes. Without even picking up the pencil, you can see already that the outline looks pretty good and very much like a flamingo, even though it\u2019s just triangles, ovals and oblongs. More importantly, the proportions are correct, ie: the legs look long and spindly enough, that neck is the right length and the body is neither too big or small. The confidence this gives you now to move in and add the more realistic shapes and details cannot be overstated. Now It's Your Turn Now print a copy of my reference photo at the size you want - black and white will be fine. Using a piece of tracing paper (or if you haven\u2019t got tracing paper, greaseproof/baking paper will work just as well) tape it down lightly over your photo to keep it in place. Now lightly sketch in several basic shapes to create the rough outline of the flamingo. Don\u2019t add any detail yet. You don\u2019t have to use the same shapes that I\u2019ve used. You might see various parts of the bird differently. That\u2019s fine. It\u2019s how you see it that matters 4Basic Shapes over photo.jpeg I\u2019ve done my pencil outline a little heavier than normal so you can see it clearer, but when you do this yourself, keep it feint and just dark enough that you can see it. Once you\u2019ve put in the bolder, more realistic lines, you can gently erase the guidelines to leave a clean image. Remember, you\u2019re not tracing the outline. It\u2019s merely an estimation of shape and form - but it will be a close one at that. 5Shapes removed from photo.jpeg Next, remove your tracing paper from the photo and comparing it all the time, start making a more realistic outline of the bird, using the basic shapes as a guide, as I have started to do on the photo below. Note that my sketch is a bit smudgy. This is because I was using a plastic eraser on the grease-proof paper and it's made it look a bit messy. A putty eraser would have been better. 6Pencil Details.jpeg Once you\u2019ve completed this bit, gently erase the original rough guidelines and add in any further detail you want, such as feathers, the eye, shading and so on. Here\u2019s my version below. I\u2019ve gone over this one in ink so you can see it more clearly but a pencil is fine.",
