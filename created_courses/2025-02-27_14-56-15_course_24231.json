You'll explore how to export and import modules, understand the differences between default exports and named exports, and utilize advanced techniques such as re-exports and dynamic imports. Additionally, you'll learn about module syntax, interoperability with CommonJS and AMD, and best practices for organizing and managing modular code in JavaScript applications. By the end of the course, you'll have the skills to effectively leverage ES6 modules to build modular, maintainable, and scalable JavaScript applications.",
