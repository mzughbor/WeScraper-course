The language is moribund. Around 10 fluent speakers are left; the overall number of potential speakers is less than 40 individuals. All speakers are found in the generation of 50 years and older. Recent local statistics indicate that there are around 260 individuals of ethnic Enets origin. Enets belongs to the Northern branch of the Samoyedic languages, in turn a branch of the Uralic language family.There are two distinct dialects, Forest (Bai) Enets and Tundra (Madu or Somatu) Enets, which may be considered separate languages.Forest Enets is the smaller of the two Enets dialects. In the winter of 2006/2007, approximately 35 people spoke it (6 in Dudinka, 20 in Potapova and 10 in Tukhard, the youngest of whom was born in 1962 and the oldest in 1945). Many of these speakers are trilingual, with competence in Forest Enets, Tundra Nenets and Russian, preferring to speak Tundra Nenets.The two dialects differ both in phonology and in lexicon. Additional variation was found in early Enets records from the 17th to 19th centuries, though all these varieties can be assigned as either Tundra Enets or Forest Enets.LINKS: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enets_language#:~:text=Enets%20is%20a%20moribund%20Samoyedic,The%20language%20is%20moribund.https://www.google.com/search?q=enets+language&oq=enet&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l3j69i57j69i60j69i61j69i6"

Looking forward to hearing from you!Georgian is a South Caucasian or Kartvelian language. It is spoken mainly in Georgia, where it is the official language, and also in Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Iran. In 2014 there were about 3.7 million speakers of Georgian.Georgian is related to Mingrelian, Laz, and Svan, all of which are spoken mainly in Georgia and are written with the Georgian (Mkhedruli) alphabet.Georgian is thought to share a common ancestral language with the other South Caucasian languages. It started to develop as a separate language during the 1st millenium BC in an area that became the Kingdom of Iberia (c. 302 BC - 580 AD). It was first referred to in writing in the 2nd century AD by the Roman grammarian, Marcus Cornelius Fronto, in a letter to the emperor Marcus Aurelius.Written GeorgianThe Georgian language first appeared in writing in about 430 AD in an inscription in a church in Palestine in an alphabet known as Asomtavruli. Before then the main written language used in Georgia was a form of Aramaic known as Armazuli (\u10d0\u10e0\u10db\u10d0\u10d6\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10d3\u10d0\u10db\u10ec\u10d4\u10e0\u10da\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0). Two other alphabets have been used to write Georgian: Nushkhuri and Mkhedruli, which is the alphabet currently used.Asomtavruli (\u10d0\u10e1\u10dd\u10db\u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10e0\u10e3\u10da\u10d8)The Georgian language first appeared in writing in about 430 AD in an inscription in a church in Palestine. At that time it was written with an alphabet known as Asomtavruli (\u10d0\u10e1\u10dd\u10db\u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10e0\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 - \"capital letters\") or Mrglovani (\u10e0\u10d2\u10da\u10dd\u10d5\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8 - \"rounded\"), which was used until the 9th century. Asomtavruli was probably modelled on the Greek alphabet, and Georgian scholars believe that King Pharnavaz I (\u10e4\u10d0\u10e0\u10dc\u10d0\u10d5\u10d0\u10d6\u10d8) of Kartli (Iberia) created it."

The influence of Russian in general is overwhelming (in 1979, 75.2% of the Evenkis spoke Russian, rising to 92.7% in 2002).

The Evenki language varies considerably among its dialects, which are divided into three large groups: the northern, the southern and the eastern dialects.

Some Latgalian speakers can also be found in Siberia and Bashkiriya in the Russian Federation. While officially considered a variant of Latvian, Latgalian is protected by the Latvian Language Law, which ensures its preservation, protection, and development as a historical variant of the Latvian language. There is ongoing debate among linguists, such as Antons Breidaks and Lidija Leikuma, about whether Latgalian should be considered a separate language. Since 1991, there has been a renewed interest in Latgalian, with its inclusion in university courses, publication of books in the language, occasional presence on television, and even some rock groups performing in Latgalian.If you are interested to see your native language/dialect be featured here.
